# Description

This is a fun little app created with just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and utilizes the dnd5e API. Users can search for information on certain Dungeons & Dragons monsters by typing the name in the search bar. For example, if you type in "adult red dragon", the stats for that monster will show.

# ToDos

Working on getting the monter's image to show on the screen.
While most of the data shows on the page, I'm still working on displaying all the API data.
Major Styling still needs to happen!
